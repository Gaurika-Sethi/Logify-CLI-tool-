During the terminal session, several commands were executed primarily involving the TTM tool and some basic shell commands. The first part of the session contained attempts to echo sensitive information marked as "SECRET," with varying visibility of the actual value across multiple logs. Later, a version check for Git revealed version 2.47.0.windows.1. Several TTM commands, including inputs and search, returned errors stating they were unknown commands. Further attempts to log information and export data resulted in errors due to unrecognized commands or issues with ES module scope in a JavaScript file. The session ended with an error related to a Node.js version, indicating a problem with module type definitions.
